## Aims

The aims of the reproducibility working group are:

- Improve measurement reproducibility through the creation of informative documentation regarding experimental set-up and standardisation of instrumentation
- Generate general guidelines on data reduction, to ensure accurate and reproducible data
- Engage others in reproducible analysis, including help documentation and guides

To get involved in the Reproducibility working group you should sign up to GitHub and take a look at the [actions](https://github.com/reflectivity/reproducibility/projects). You can become a member by emailing one of the working group co-chairs.

### Dissemination

- [Bayesian analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10406): a short article outlining best practice for Bayesian analysis reporting
- [Standard samples](../../projects/standard_samples): tell us about the samples you measure regularly by contributing
- [Calibrations](../../projects/calibrations): We want to share how we check out beamlines are correct
- [Checklist](../../projects/checklist): A checklist to help users follow best practice in experimental preparation
