# the 5th Open Reflectometry Standards Organisation ORSO annual meeting in collaboration with DAPHNE4NFDI
Took place online at 12:00 to 16:00 CET (20:00-00:00 Aus, 06:00-10:00 US East coast) on the 21st of June 2023. 

Unlike previous years this meeting only included a short half-day workshop and an administrative AGM.
This year the focus was on
* machine learning and 
* FAIR data. 

In Germany we have a large consortium DAPHNE4NFDI which aims to make research data FAIR in the field of X-ray and neutron science. The special thing about DAPHNE4NFDI is that it is jointly organized by users and facilities.  We know of course that FAIR data and advanced analysis schemes via AI/ML are a topic of interest basically everywhere. 

These sessions at the ORSO annual meeting had the aim of discussing the status-quo of meta-data, archiving and re-using of data in our Reflectometry community and at the different facilities. 

[Registration is now open](https://indico.esss.lu.se/event/3289)

## Schedule:

## 12:00-13:00: Machine learning (Chair: Bridget Murphy)
The workshop started with a scientific contribution outlining machine learning applications and software solutions for X-ray and neutron reflectivity in a DAPHNE4NFDI/ORSO joint session

12:00 -12:05 Welcome (Tom Arnold (ESS))

12:05- 12:35 Frank Schreiber  (University of Tübingen): Machine learning for reflectometry: Concepts, applications, and challenges 

12:35-12:45 Vladimir Starostin  (University of Tübingen): Machine learning for reflectometry: Algorithms and performance

12:45-13:00  Discussion

## 14:00-16:00: FAIR data for reflectometry (Chair: Bridget Murphy)
This is another DAPHNE4NFDI/ORSO joint session:
The aim of this session was to discuss and adopt an international community standard set of defined metadata for reflectometry experiments and the creation of a community catalogue of reflectometry reference data.
