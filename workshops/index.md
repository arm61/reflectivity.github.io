# Upcoming events

## the Open Reflectometry Standards Organisation ORSO annual meeting in collaboration with DAPHNE4NFDI
Will take place online at 12:00 to 16:00 CET (20:00-00:00 Aus, 06:00-10:00 US East coast) on the 21st of June 2023. 

Unlike previous years this meeting will only include a short half-day workshop and an administrative AGM.
This year the focus will be on
* machine learning and 
* FAIR data. 

In Germany we have a large consortium DAPHNE4NFDI which aims to make research data FAIR in the field of X-ray and neutron science. The special thing about DAPHNE4NFDI is that it is jointly organized by users and facilities.  We know of course that FAIR data and advanced analysis schemes via AI/ML are a topic of interest basically everywhere. 

We would like to ask you to join these sessions at the ORSO annual meeting with the aim of discussing the status-quo of meta-data, archiving and re-using of data in our Reflectometry community and at the different facilities. 

[Registration is now open](https://indico.esss.lu.se/event/3289)

## Preliminary Schedule:

## 12:00-13:00: Machine learning (Chair: Bridget Murphy)
The workshop will start with a scientific contribution outlining machine learning applications and software solutions for X-ray and neutron reflectivity in a DAPHNE4NFDI/ORSO joint session

12:00 -12:05 Welcome (Tom Arnold (ESS))

12:05- 12:35 Frank Schreiber  (University of Tübingen): Machine learning for reflectometry: Concepts, applications, and challenges 

12:35-12:45 Vladimir Starostin  (University of Tübingen): Machine learning for reflectometry: Algorithms and performance

12:45-13:00  Discussion

## 13:00-13:50: AGM (Chair: Tom Arnold)
13:00 – 13.30: Short Reports from each of the Working groups.

13:30 - 13:50: Discussion of the [draft constitution](https://www.reflectometry.org/what_is_orso/ORSO_constitution). Please review this and if you have some feedback before or after the meeting please use the [github issue](https://github.com/reflectivity/edu_outreach/issues/41) or email [Tom](mailto:tom.arnold@ess.eu).

13:50 - 14:00  short break

## 14:00-16:00: FAIR data for reflectometry (Chair: Bridget Murphy)
The aim of this session is to discuss and adopt an international community standard set of defined metadata for reflectometry experiments.

14:00 - 16:00 Finding data DAPHNE4NFDI/ORSO joint session: We aim to determine a community-based definition for reflectivity metadata based and creation of a community catalogue of reflectometry reference data.

14:00 - 14:05 	Bridget Murphy (CAU-Kiel): Brief introduction and Outline of session 

14:05 - 14:20  	Heike Görzig (HZB): Metadata to make FAIR data 

14:20 - 15:20 5 minute (maximum) impulse talks 
* Nicolas Hayen  (CAU- KielP08/PETRA III) 		Metadata for X-ray reflectivity at P08/PETRA III
* Sebastain Busch (Hereon) (TBC) 			Meta data catalogue for Neutron reflectivity at REFSANS/ MLZ
* Further talks to be confirmed
Please contact [Bridget](mailto:murphy@physik.uni-kiel.de) if you would like to present a 5 minute impulse presentation of the metadata you require for your reflectivity data.

15:20 - 16:00 Discussion
