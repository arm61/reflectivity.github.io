ORSO is an open group of reflectometry scientists from across the globe that are interested in improving our field through collaboration.
Our focus is on [neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_reflectometry) and [X-ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_reflectivity) reflectometry, and it should be noted that the term [reflectometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectometry) is also used for a number of techniques that are not covered by this organisation.

The rules by which ORSO is governed and a code of conduct (currently in draft form) is avilable [here](../what_is_orso/ORSO_constitution.md) 

On this webpage, we host [information](../information/) about reflectometry that we have generated to inform others and detail [projects](../projects/) that are being developed within our [working groups](../working_groups).
The organisation has hosted two [workshops](../workshops/) to date and more are planned.
